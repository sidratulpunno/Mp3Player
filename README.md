Mp3Player made using java swing
Digital music players have become an integral part of our
lives, offering convenience and versatility. This paper describes
the architecture and implementation of a Java Swing MP3
player that provides an intuitive user interface for users to listen to local MP3 audio files. The player has standard features
including loop functionality, next/previous song navigation,
and play/pause buttons. Users can choose a directory holding
MP3 files by clicking the ”Open folder” button, and those
files are subsequently added to the playlist. For convenient
selection, the song list shows every song on the playlist.
Through the use of Java Swing elements such as text fields,
labels, and buttons, the player offers a user-friendly interface.
Reliability is ensured by using the Java Media Framework for
MP3 audio decoding and playing. Moreover, future feature
improvements are made possible by the player’s extensibility.
